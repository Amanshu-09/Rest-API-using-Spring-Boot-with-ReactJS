# Rest-API-using-Spring-Boot-with-ReactJS

It's an simple web application for managing Courses.
* Here you can create user account and add your courses.
  And after creating a account you can login and check the courses you 
  added previously. And also can perform add, update and delete
  Operations for your account.

I had used spring boot as a backend of this application
And Used react js as frontend of the application and used
MySQL for Database Connection.
